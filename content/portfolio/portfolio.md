I built this portfolio using Hugo as a place for me to showcase all the projects I have/ am working on outside of work to further my web development skills. I used Hugo as the front end frame work and currently I have it hosted on Github Pages since they offer free hosting but that is planned to change. I found hugo easy to use and highly customizable depending on the theme you chose - Portio offered a clean stylish look and was highly customizable


Version 2 will include: 1) an overlay on the images in my portfolio section to show the summary of the project on hover 2) Particle.js effects applied to the background 3) Will be hosted on IPFS
