shortDescription: I am building an online store for my friend to sell her retail items.

I am working on this website for my friend who is an amazing artist and want to start her own clothing line. 

I am using React because this framework offers lots of useful functionalities like lazy loading, redux and is generally very modular and easy to use. I am using Firebase to store information about the items being sold on the site. This database service from Google offers robust functionality and is free for the amount of storage needed for this website. 


I plan on implementing Doge and Bitcoin as acceptable payments methods. This is a feature I am very excited to implement as it will be a great learning experience and will show my support for the crypto community.
