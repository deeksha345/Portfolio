Description of game from steam: "Ghostlight Manor is a strategic puzzler with 60 hauntingly challenging levels. Encounter a cast of beloved classic monsters while locating the source of the monster invasion before itâ€™s too late! In multiplayer test your skills against our brand new A.I."


When starting out my internship as a developer at the DFL I worked on fixing various bugs in order to get used to the code base and also learn Unity and it's features more in depth. The main feature addition that I helped with was implementing the decision tree A.I in multiplayer mode. The basic funtionality was that there were specific priorities set to each space on the grid and each monster type and those priorities would influence the A.I's decision. We also implemented 3 different difficulties for the A.I making it accessible for beginners and expert level players.
